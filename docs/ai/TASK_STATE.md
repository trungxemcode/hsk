# HSK Cross-AI Handoff

## Verified checkpoint — 2026-10-16
- GitHub `https://github.com/trungxemcode/hsk`, `main` is the source of truth.
- Single local checkout: `C:\Users\LENOVO\hsk`. The older copy at `C:\New folder\hsk` was consolidated into this directory, then retired.
- The last verified app release was 2.16. The last known canonical code commit when consolidating was `58f781c`; do **not** assume it remains latest: check GitHub before work.
- Codex, Antigravity, Gemini and Claude share the root `AGENTS.md` and focused architecture `docs/ai/PROJECT_MAP.md` through small agent-specific entry files.
- Serena project configuration was migrated from the old checkout to `.serena/` in this checkout and is excluded from Git. RTK and Codex configuration reside in the Windows user profile, outside the repository. Earlier AI notes remain in the separate archived backup.

## Current work
- Single-workspace consolidation: canonical Git `main`, Serena configuration local-only, old checkout retired. No app logic or PWA assets changed.
- Do not commit machine-local `.serena/`, RTK, Codex or editor setup. Use tracked shared `AGENTS.md` and `docs/ai/` for portable, compact AI context.
- Follow-on tasks must be requested by the user; no pending feature is implied.

Do not store secrets, API keys, personal data, or entire chat logs. This file is a checkpoint, never a substitute for checking actual code or Git state.

## UI follow-up — rounded press states (2.17)
- Fix: `ui-buttons.css` summaries use the same shared radius tokens as their frames; standalone summaries use the button radius. Expanded framed headers keep rounded top corners. Native rectangular tap highlight is disabled; keyboard outline, geometry and handlers remain intact. No global overflow clipping or learning-data changes.
- Tests: press shape at 320/390/1440 light/dark, mobile UX and 552 responsive cases pass locally. Full Studio CI passed on application commit `81e0c45`; the follow-up commit changes only this handoff to preserve the concurrent workspace-consolidation notes.
- Release: PWA metadata bumped to 2.17. Verify Pages and asset hashes after merge. Windows checkout/configuration was not modified by this cloud task.

## UI follow-up — daily-word spacing (2.18)
- `home-overview.css`: daily-word summary has 8px vertical / 12px horizontal padding in every interaction state. Border-box sizing keeps it inside the existing row; no state-dependent padding or handler/data changes.
- `check-press-shape-ui.cjs` asserts padding and unchanged normal/focused geometry. Home compactness and responsive checks cover the increased content height. PWA release 2.18 must pass CI and Pages verification.
